# Node.js Backend Starter – OpenAPI Spec Driven

This project is a backend starter template built using Node.js and Express. It follows an **API-first approach** using the OpenAPI specification, with autogenerated server code and pluggable business logic.

## API Endpoints

- GET /users – Get all users

- POST /users – Create a user

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/api-docs
OpenAPI JSON/YAML: http://localhost:8080/openapi

## Features

- API-first development using OpenAPI (YAML)
- Server scaffolded with `openapi-generator`
- Swagger UI available at `/api-docs`
- Request validation using `express-openapi-validator`
- Real business logic separated into `src/services` for clean regeneration
- Easy regeneration on spec changes

## How I Set This Up

1. Studied the Python FastAPI starter, which auto-generates OpenAPI docs.
2. Understood the OpenAPI-first workflow, where endpoints are defined before any code is written.
3. Created `docs/api.yaml` as the contract.
4. Used `openapi-generator-cli` to scaffold server code:
   ```bash
   npm run generate:server

## How to Run (Cloned Repos)

- npm install
- npm start

## Regenerating (Only if Spec Changes)

- npm run generate:server
